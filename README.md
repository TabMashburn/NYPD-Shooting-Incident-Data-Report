NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report

In this project, we aim at exploring New York City shooting incidents data from 2006 to 2020 so that we can answer the questions below:

1. Overall trend of shooting incidents in NYC since 2006.
2. Map of shooting incidents by locations.
3. Trend of shooting incidents in NYC by location.
4. Gender distribution of perpetrators and victims.
5. Linear model to show the relation between household income and shooting incidents numbers.
